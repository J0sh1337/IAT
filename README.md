# Implicit Association Test (IAT)

## Background

This is a different version of the popular [IAT](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) created by Harvard psychologists.
This app is used to measure implicit racial attitudes by measuring reaction time in responding to animations of black/white men shooting
at you.


## Instructions

You have to press the green button to shoot the target if he has a gun, and refrain from shooting if he doesn't.
